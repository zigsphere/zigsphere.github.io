title: Joe's Tech Interview Questions
---

I've been in tech for a long time and have interviewed quite a bit from small to very large companies. All of the questions mentioned on this page are ones I have been asked for IT-related positions. Each time a question was asked, I'd write it down. I thought I would share these with all of you for those who are wanting to study for their next interview. Enjoy!
