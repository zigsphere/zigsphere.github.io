Well, it's been a long time since I've written anything. More than a year, in fact.

So, to pick up where I left off from my previous post, I would like to say that I am one happy father. My daughter, Brooklyn, is now 8 months old. Time has flown by so quickly. So when people say, "love on your kids, hold them, spend time with them, play with them, etc before they grow up", well, they weren't kidding. My wife and I are the happiest parents and we are so gratefully to have such a wonderful, beautiful, and healthy daughter. 

So about me. I left Uber in the beginning of November 2018 and moved to Twitch, which is a video streaming company owned by Amazon. I left to a new adventure to get an opportunity to learn and grow with new technologies and with an even bigger infrastructure. It has been quite fun and I am learning every single day :) There, I am an Infrastructure Systems Engineer on the Video Core Services team. This is actually a brand new team at the company, with the intentions to own all of the bare metal servers and core services (DNS, Consul, Squid, etc) within Twitch's infrastructure.

My mental health for the past ~9 months has been kind of poor since I have been suffering from anxiety. This is something that many people in the tech industry have. I've been trying to cope with it as much as I can without having to take any medication, since the medication was having a negative side affect on me. Currently, things have been ok for me, which I am grateful for. I have such supportive friends, family, and my wonderful wife.

I do intend to continue posting here on my blog moving forward. I suppose the only reason I haven't was because I didn't know how I was going to explain why I haven't posted in such a long time. Honestly, it's just been hobbies, daughter, and life that has been distracting me in doing so.

I've been trying to come up with more personal tech project to start during my "free" time. I do have a short list so far. Once they are ongoing, I will post all about them here, which I am really excited to share about. I started a new tech community last year, which is on Discord, a popular chat platform for gamers. I actually see it now as a chat platform for everyone as there have been so many communities that are not gaming related at all, such as mine. Anyone is welcome to join. Mine is called [**DevOps, SRE, and Infrastructure**](https://www.discord.gg/FEES8Fw), which are three of the main things I am interested in. It has grown quite a bit in the last year to about 421 members. I'm hoping to get so many more in the near future.

Well, I am so happy to be back! Stay tuned for more content!
