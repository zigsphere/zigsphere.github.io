As you may know, I enjoy playing the drums. Chances are, if you've only known me for a few years, you probably never noticed I played them or had any interest in them. Well, that's because I didn't have a set to play with.

Back when I was in high school and some college, I played the drums as a hobby. I still have yet to learn to read music, but I think I do pretty well with playing the drums anyway. I've always had an interest in playing them, even tapping on random things every day. When I was 18 years old, I finally bought my own acoustic drum set and played in a small garage band with some friends. After a few years, the drums were warped due to moisture and cold air outside and were destroyed.

After about my 4th year in college (after playing drums in a few churches), I stopped playing the drums, because life happened. I was busy with school, busy with work, and busy with life. I also didn't live in a place big enough to have a drum set, and if I did, I knew it would be too loud for the neighbors next door. 
As you may have seen in my previous posts, I finally bought a house. This meant there was potential of buying another set of drums and playing them since I have so much space. Yes, I was still busy with life, but I come to realize that I need to have more hobbies, just like I did when I was younger. I can't let things get in the way of having fun with what I like to do. Last week, I finally searched around online for drum sets. Not just any drum set, but an electric drum set. I figured that, instead of being extremely loud inside the house and potentially being loud enough for the neighbors to hear, I would invest in something that would be much quieter and have the potential to connect to a computer for recording purposes. My main focus was getting a Roland-named set. Roland is one of the top of the line brands and they make really good music equipment. The only problem with this is that they are expensive. Buying something reliable and having a good brand-name stamped to a drum set comes with a price. That's the reason I decided to look online at used sets. Sure there are brand new ones for around $4000+, but there are some used, previous models that do so much already, so I didn't care. There may be older models that may even do more than the newer models.

I finally found a set online, the Roland TD-10. It has 4 toms, 2 crash, 1 ride, 1 kick, 1 hi-hat, and 1 snare. This was perfect for what I wanted to do. The only problem with the set was that it did have a dead battery, but for $3, I bought a new battery and installed it the first day and works great.

I was finally able to bring back memories and get back into drumming. I can't tell you how happy I was after I set these up after bringing them home.
