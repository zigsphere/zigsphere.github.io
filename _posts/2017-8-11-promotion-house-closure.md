title: Promotion and House Closure
---

It's been a few weeks since I've posted anything. Wanted to give an update that on Friday, August 4th, I got news that I've been promoted to the next position at Uber. I am now a Systems Engineer II on the Corp Site Reliability Engineering team. This is my 2 years and 2 months at Uber and can't be happier. It's been quite the journey and every day is an adventure. Something that I am so ecstatic about. I would like to thank everyone for all of the support you've given me throughout the years. I wouldn't have done it without you.

Today, the third house we put an offer on has closed. My wife and I are now homeowners, which is a huge milestone in our lives. Never did I know I would be BUYING a house in the bay area because of the expensive cost of living, one of the [most expensive places](https://sf.curbed.com/2017/2/22/14700442/san-francisco-rents-highest-world-price) to live in the world. We can start moving into our house starting in 3 days, since the current tenants are still staying there for a few days to move out. Honestly, in the beginning when looking for a house, the stress I didn't really see. I enjoyed looking at all the houses near us and visioning what we would do in each room. After placing an offer on a house; however, is when the stress hits. The numbers become a reality and is probably one of the most scariest / stressful? things I've experienced. I'm pretty sure buying a house takes a year off of your life. We did it though. As I told everyone, it's all about budgeting - wants vs needs. Plan spending accordingly and even budget an amount to put away in savings.
