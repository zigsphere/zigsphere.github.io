Hello World!
Today, I started to spin up my own blog site. Rather than going out to social media and sharing what I've been up to, I decided to bring everything to my own site. I love sharing with the world what I've been doing, my adventures around the world, personal tech projects, and pretty much anything else you can think of.

I'm extremely excited to finally be able to spin something like this up. I've been looking around on the internet to decide what blog platform to write on. Rather it being hosted by another company, I decided to spin up my own hosted server and manage it myself. Yes, I'm happy to say, my managed server is managed with Puppet Enterprise, same with all the other servers I own. 

Well, please feel free to browse around. I plan on adding more content very soon.
